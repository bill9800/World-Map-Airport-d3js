## Preparation
1. Get world map information from [**Natural Earth**](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/). 
2. Get airport location information also from Natural Earth.
3. Because the map file is not available to be used by D3js, transfer the file to topojason on [**Mapshaper**](mapshaper.org).
4. Use web crawler to get more information about the airport. I wrote a python web crawler to complete this task.
